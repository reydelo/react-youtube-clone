React 'components' used to refer to templates, sub templates, and packages?

components - files are CamelCase
methods are lowerCamelCase

npm install, npm start

remove index.js file, reducers directory, actions directory

let for any variable that can change
const for any read-only variable

jsx - html inside of javascript file
curly brakets in jsx lets you console.log and such!

wtf is super?

allow time to process, think of the answer, before giving it and moving forward
